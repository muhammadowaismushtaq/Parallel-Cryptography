# Parallel Cryptography
> Creation Date:  
## Description
The purpose of the console based application entitled “Parallel Cryptography” is to encrypt simple text, to avoid security issues and to be able to communicate in terms of emergency without letting undesirable individuals know the contents of the original message. The process of text encryption has been around from the Ancient Greek period. And military officials use encryption to communicate with each other in war or in a state of emergency. Historically, encryption methods like Morse code and Caesar Cipher were used. But nowadays, due to advanced computers, traditional encryption methods such as Morse code have become weak, so the need for new encryption methods is felt.
